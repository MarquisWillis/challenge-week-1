# challenge-week-1

## Description

This project was geared towards using semantic HTML to ease the readibility of the code provided. The CSS style sheet also required modification due to redundancy in the code, which meant grouping selctors was required.

- Using semantics greatly increased the assessibility and ease of reading to reviewers 
- Grouping style selectors in the CSS sheet trimed 50 lines of code, and is also much easier to interpret
- Reordering the CSS sheet made it much easier to follow the styling patterns 
- Having a descriptive title is much needed, albeit a seemingly small detail
